My name is Daniel Nedosseikine.

Currently I'm doing my Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering and working as
a Hardware & Firmware Engineer.

When I have free time I like to make my own personal projects to learn and
discover new things. In this page you can find some articles explaining what I've
been learning during these years.

I don't own a Mac computer...yet.

You can find my GitHub, Stackoverflow and LinkedIn pages below.
